# Python

This repository consists a Jupyter Notebook which contains the EDA of the Datasets.

During our practice of Machine Learning or related things, the first step for every algorithm is to explore the data which is Exploratory Data Analysis.

I have created a python package where it can be used in your local system by importing it whenever you want to do the EDA.

### Procedure Followed
  1. Taken Histogram, barplot and boxplot for the EDA.
  2. If the data is numerical and continuous, then we have considered the histogram.
  3. If the data is numerical and finite i.e; Ordinal, then we have considered the barplot.
  4. If the data is categorical, then we need to plot the boxplot.
  5. All the plots obtained will be stored in the given directory as a seperate folder for each type of plot
